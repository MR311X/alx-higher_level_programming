N Queens Puzzle Solver

The N queens puzzle is the challenge of placing N non-attacking queens on an
NÃ—N chessboard.

Usage: nqueens N
    If the user called the program with the wrong number of arguments,
    print Usage: nqueens N, followed by a new line,
    and exit with the status 1
where N must be an integer greater or equal to 4
    If N is not an integer, print N must be a number, followed by a new line,
    and exit with the status 1
    If N is smaller than 4, print N must be at least 4, followed by a new line,
    and exit with the status 1
The program should print every possible solution to the problem
    One solution per line
    Format: see example
You are only allowed to import the sys module
